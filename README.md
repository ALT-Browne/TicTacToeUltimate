<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

* This project creates an advanced version of the well-known game TicTacToe, called TicTacToe Ultimate! In this version, players try to win the main game by competing in 9 sub-games. The location of each move determines the next sub-game to be played. The game history is saved so that players can undo moves and restart the game from any previous point.
